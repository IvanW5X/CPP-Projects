# C++ Projects

## Overview

This is a repository of small(ish) projects that have been coded in C++. These projects include personal and university projects created by me.
The goal of these projects is to gain experience and knowledge for bigger and more ambitious projects.

### Basketball Catalog

The Basketball Catalog program is designed to manage and organize information about basketball players, teams, and games. It allows users to add, update, and delete records, as well as search and display detailed information about players and teams. The program aims to provide an easy-to-use interface for basketball enthusiasts to keep track of their favorite players and teams.

### Coffee Shop

The coffee shop program is a coffee ordering simulator, allowing a user to add/remove a new or existing coffee, view each coffee name and price, and place orders specifying the coffee name and quantity. Created using object oriented principles, there is also a cloning option of the Shop object, performing deep copies.

### Data Structures

The data structs project is collection of redefined data structures such as a dynamic array/vector, linked list, binary search tree, and more.

### Hunt the Wumpus

Hunt the Wumpus is a terminal based spinoff of the existing Hunt the Wumpus game. On program start, a user is able to select the grid game size by inputing the number of rows and columns, select game mode (cheats or no cheats), and begin playing the game with the objective to find and retrive the hidden gold event, or shoot an arrow at the moving Wumpus.

### To-Do List

The to-do list program simulates a terminal based to-do list, using a linked lists to store tasks and a txt file to save previous session data.
