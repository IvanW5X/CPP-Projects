# Library Catalog

## Overview

This is a library catalog C program that simulates a library management system. Using the C programming language, the user is able to...

* Add book information
* Display book information
* List all books of a given author
* List count of books
* Remove a book given the title

## Technical Approach

The library catalog will be implemented using object oriented paradigms and file pointers to store book data from previous sessions of the program. A library will contain books and will only manage routing the books for the user at a high level, so that the book object will maintain its own functionality of being displayed and created using the books.txt file with a file pointer. Additionally, the catalog will be implemented with scalability in mind, so if there were to be many books in the txt file, they shall be stored in a hashmap that I will be implementing myself to demonstrate knowledge of data structures.

On top of implementing simple library functionality, I will also include optimization techniques, multi-threading, and more complex hashing functionlaities to display and practice skills in memory management, concurrency, thread safety, and algorithms that I've covered in univerity and from independent research, making this an absurdly secure and optimized library catalog.
